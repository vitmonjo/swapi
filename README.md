### Features
#### Asynchronous Programming: 
   This project served as an opportunity to enhance skills in handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. The following techniques were employed:
   #### async/await
   Async and await are extensively used to work with asynchronous operations, even though it's only syntactic sugar for Promises, it works and looks extremely well.
   
   #### fetch API
   The Fetch API was also employed to make network requests to SWAPI, the Star Wars API. 

   #### then()
   While async/await is used for more straightforward and readable asynchronous code, the traditional .then() syntax is also incorporated for situations where a more fine-grained control over the promise chain is necessary.

### Technologies Used
#### JavaScript;
#### Webpack;
#### HTML;
#### CSS;
#### Storage object.

### Usage
  Users can use the application to check all Pilots, Starships and Planets available on the SWAPI, a handful of them even have custom pictures.
